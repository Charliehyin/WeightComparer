# WeightComparer

Gets the weight of everyone in Ironman Casuals

Can also compare the weights of everyone in Ironman Casuals with a dataset from a prior time

How to use: 
Clone the repository, and run "npm install" in command line
At the bottom of GetWeight.js, call compareData to compare the data in OldData.txt and NewData.txt
To get new data from the Hypixel API, call getGuildData
Copy paste the data printed to the console into either OldData.txt to use the data in compareData

*sorry for the terrible coding, readme, and the lack of comments in the code, hopefully its not too hard to use
